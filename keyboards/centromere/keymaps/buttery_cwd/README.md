# # CwD's Centromere Layout

This keymap is using DennyTom's custom chording engine. Head out to DennyTom's user space to find the source files and details.

To make a real keymap from the JSON file, run 

```sh
python3 parser.py keymap_def.json keymap.c
```
from DennyTom's chording_engine folder.

VERY in progress, so expect lots of changes as I figure out how I want to implement chording!
