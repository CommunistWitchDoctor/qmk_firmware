# # CwD's Centromere Layout

This keymap is using DennyTom's custom chording engine. Head out to DennyTom's user space to find the source files and details.

To make a real keymap from the JSON file, run 

```sh
python3 parser.py keymap_def.json keymap.c
```

Likely will change with use. I enjoy the modifiers on the "home row".
